# A simple Password brute force program.
_i made this in like 2h with the help of gpt, don't judge :)_

**‚ö†Ô∏è This program is intended for educational purposes. Use legally.**

Note for non-Ubuntu Desktop users:
Do not run the **main.py** file as it most likely will not work due to the calls in main.py that require a GNOME enviroment. You can run the brute force programs individually if you want.

üìì main.py will also not work on a server enviroment.
