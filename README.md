# A simple Password brute force program.
_i made this in like 2h with the help of gpt, don't judge :)_

**‚ö†Ô∏è This program is intended for educational purposes. Use legally.**

Note for non-Ubuntu Desktop users:
I have only tested **main.py** on my Ubuntu 22 desktop, if it does not work try running random.py and common.py seperately 

üìì main.py will also not work on a server enviroment.
